# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? "Anytime you need to compare 2 variables against eachother."
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? "I would give myself more time and do the other 2 coding challenges."
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? "For me finally getting into the Git workflow repition really made me feel good about this lesson."
